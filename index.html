        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p>I am a student at Ryerson University studying software engineering. I am a
          self taught web developer in progress. My goal is to become a top notch full
          stack developer. The languages I plan on learning are Java, Python, Javascript
          and HTML/CSS. I plan on learning many different frameworks but the ones
          at the top of my list are React, NodeJS and Bootstrap.</p>

          <h3>Road Trips/Sightseeing</h3>
          <p>I like going on road trips and long drives. It is relaxing and a way
          for me to get rid of stress. It's also a way for me to spend time with my
          family which I often don't get to do because of school and work.</p>

          <h3 class="exercise">Exercising</h3>
          <p>I used to exercise at home by myself by just doing pushups everyday.
          After I started seeing gains from just doing pushups, I wanted to get stronger.
          When my university started back up in person, I started going to the gym,
          and within just 2 months I have progressed a lot faster than most people
          can because of my past strength from doing calisthenics.</p>

          <h3>Drone Photography</h3>
          <p>I picked up on flying a drone as a hobby to pass the time. But soon I started
            to love taking photographs and videos using my drone. Over time I have improved
            my skills as a drone pilot and can now take some insane shots.</p>
